EnvNotify
Autopilot Notification (No TMP Def) - ${VERSION} ${BUILD} - $(hostname):${_PLATNAME} ${TEST}
$_tmp_ not defined.
It might cause the installation failure.
I would recommend to define TMP,TEMP,TMPDIR variables.
But continue the execution.

  Machine       = $(hostname):$_PLATNAME
  Login User    = $LOGNAME
  Version:Build = $VERSION:$BUILD
  Test Script   = $TEST

  \$TMP   =$TMP
  \$TEMP  =$TEMP
  \$TMPDIR=$TMPDIR

---ALL ENV---
