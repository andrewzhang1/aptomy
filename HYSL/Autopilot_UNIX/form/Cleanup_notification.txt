Please clean up your files on $tmp_hostname:${tmp_platform}
Hi All,

There is no sufficient free space at $_sv$dskloc on $tmp_hostname.
Current free size is ${CURRFREE} KB.
Essbase server regression team uses this machine
for the automated regression test.
And it require at least $expfree KB free space.

Could you clean up your files on $tmp_hostname ?

Best regards,
$LOGNAME.
