1. Now we can see the emp1 has the raise_amount within its namespace = 1.05, and
returns that value before going and search the class and we didn't see that amount on employee 2
so that falls back to the class value before going and searching the class and we didn't set that
raise_amount on employee
2: important to know the difference for class method and instance

A class method takes cls as first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
A class method can access or modify class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
In general, static methods know nothing about class state. They are utility type methods that take some parameters
and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as parameter.
We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.

Turn a regular method(instance method) into a class method, add a decorator: @classmethod
