# 1. PRACTICE

# List: review
#list_1 = [2, 5, 8]
#print(list_1)
#list_1[0] = 100          # mutable
#print(list_1)

# Tuples: immutable, contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements
#t1 = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
#print(t1[0])
#print(t1)
#t1 = t1, (1,2,3,4,5)
#print(t1)
#t1[0] = 'immutable'     # immutable

#t1 = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' # packing
#x, y, z = t1                # unpacking
#print(x, end=', ')
#print(y, end=', ')
#print(z)

# 2. CODING
# Improve on Pizza Slicing Game.
# In the class, we talked about having to press enter multiple times to exit. See if you can improve on that.
