# 1. PRACTICE

# Numbers
print(17 / 3)      # classic division returns a float
print(17 // 3)     # floor division discards the fractional part
print(17 % 3)      # the % operator returns the remainder of the division

# Strings
word = 'Python'
print(word[0])   # character in position 0
print(word[5])   # character in position 5
print(word[-1])  # last character
#print(word[2:4])   # upper bound exclusive
print(word.__len__())
#print(len(word))
#print("p" in word) # True or False?
#print("P" in word) # True or False?
sentence = 'Python is my favorite programming language'
print ("programming" in sentence) # search word

# Lists
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares)
#print(squares[0])

# 2. CODING

# Create a program that gets a message from the user and then prints it out backwards.

word = input()

print(word)

# Bonus: create a prgram that gets a word from the user and count how many times it appeared in this paragraph:
# # "While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language,
# this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python.
# It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions."
